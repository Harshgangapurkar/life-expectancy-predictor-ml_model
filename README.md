# 🧬 Life Expectancy Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses a machine learning regression model to predict **Life Expectancy** based on various socio-economic and health-related factors like GDP, schooling, HIV/AIDS rates, etc.  
It includes a **user-friendly web-based GUI** for real-time predictions built using **Gradio**, with support from **ChatGPT**.
